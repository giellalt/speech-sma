0) move audio files to fastpitch/ root

shuf acapela_m_desc_tts_pitch.txt > acapela_m_desc_tts_pitch_shuf.txt

6) create validation lists, take maybe 50-100 sents from the end of the shuffled lists (50 val)

7) create a train.sh and change the paths of the filelists and datasets accordingly as well as the symbol set; remember to change the symbols.py as well, and add the new symbol set to the end of the script as well
